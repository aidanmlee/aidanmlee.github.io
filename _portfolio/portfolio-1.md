This was my final project for COMM 1260 course at BCIT. The objective was to build a fully-functioning help system, in HTML 5 output, using MadCap Flare. 

Catered towards people who:
* Have never played Persona 5 Royal
* May be new to turn-based Japanese role-playing games

The help system may also be used by people returning to Persona 5 Royal or those who have only played the original version of the game

The look of the help system was inspired by Persona 5 Royal's own visual cues and UI. The hope was to have the help system look as if it could be a part of the game.
