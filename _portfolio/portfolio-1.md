This was my final project for COMM 1260 course at BCIT. The objective was to build a fully-functioning help system, with HTML 5 output, using MadCap Flare. 

The system was catered towards people who:
* Have never played Persona 5 Royal
* May be new to turn-based Japanese role-playing games

The help system may also be useful to people returning to Persona 5 Royal or for those who have only experienced the original version of the game.

The design of the help system was inspired by Persona 5 Royal's visual cues and UI, aiming to make it feel like a seamless part of the game.
