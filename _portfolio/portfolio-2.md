This was our final project for COMM 1009 at BCIT. As a group of 5, we were tasked with producing a targeted travel guide for another country. We decided upon creating a guide centred around travelling around Tokyo on a limited budget.

Our target audience was young Canadian (students) in their 20's-30's who:
* Have a limited/fixed budget to travel
* May be interested in staying out late and travelling
* Might be interested in Japan and Japanese culture
* Might need to overcome culture/communication barrier
* Might value a physical brochure they can carry around in a country they may not always have access to internet in


The brochure was created using Canva. My contribution to the project may be viewed [here](/files/aidanleetokyoguide.pdf)
