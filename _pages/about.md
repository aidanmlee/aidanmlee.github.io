My name is Aidan Lee. I live in Vancouver, British Columbia. I (somehow) graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2023 with a degree in English Language. I'm currently pursuing a certificate in Technical Writing from the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) and am seeking opportunities to further hone my writing skills. Feel free to browse my CV and portfolio of classwork!
